   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Beast Remote Controller's documentation!
===================================================

This is documentation for a remote control web application.  Right now, I run this on a server within my network and
I can control the media/volume from a web browser on my phone.  It could very easily be adapted to a first class mobile
application.
